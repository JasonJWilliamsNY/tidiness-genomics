title: Genomics data - Metadata and tidiness

## Learning Objectives 
* Think about and understand the types of metadata a sequencing experiment will generate
* Make decisions about how (if) data will be stored, archived, shared, etc. 
* Anticipate strategies we will need to learn in the rest of the lesson set. 

## Lesson 

There are a variety ways to approach working with a large sequencing dataset. You may be a novice who has not used bioinformatics tools beyond doing BLAST searches. You may have bioinformatics experience with other types of data and are working with high-throughput (NGS) sequence data for the first time. Either way, these lessons for you! In the most important ways, the methods and approaches we need in bioinformatics are the same ones we need at the bench or in the field - planning, documenting, and organizing  will be the key to good reproducible science. 

## Discussion Questions

Before we go any further here are some important questions to consider. If you are learning at a workshop, please discuss these questions with your neighbor (this is a good chance to introduce yourself) and your instructors will collect your answers (on minute cards or in the Etherpad).

**Metadata** 
1. What is your definition of metadata?
2. What kinds of metadata might a sequencing project generate?

**Working with sequence data**
1. What challenges do you think you'll face (or have already faced) in working with a large sequence dataset?
2. What is your strategy for saving and sharing your sequence files?
3. How can you be sure that your raw data are unintentionally uncorrupted?
4. Where/how will you (did you) analyze your data - what software, what computer(s)?

## Exercises

**A. Sending samples to the facility**

The first step in sending your sample for sequencing will be to complete a form documenting the metadata for the facility. Take a look at the following submission spreadsheet:

**B. Retrieving samples from the facility**
